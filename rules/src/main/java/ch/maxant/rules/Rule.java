/**
 * An {@link Engine} contains a list of rules.  The engine 
 * can then be asked to provide the outcome of the Action associated with the best 
 * matching rule (see {@link Engine#executeBestAction(String, Object, java.util.Collection)}), 
 * or to provide a list of matching rules (see {@link Engine#getMatchingRules(String, Object)}).  
 * Each rule is "evaluated"
 * by using the {@link #expression} supplied in the constructor 
 * {@link #Rule(String, String, String, int, String)}.
 * The expression must be valid expression language.  During evaludation, 
 * the input object passed to the engine is mapped to the name "input", which can be
 * used in the rules.  For example, consider the following rule:<br>
 * <br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>input.person1.name == "ant" &amp;&amp; input.person1.gender == "male"</code><br>
 * <br>
 * Note how the rule evaluates to "true" or "false".  For any rule to be a candidate
 * to have an associated {@link IAction} executed, it must evaluate to "true".  The rule in the 
 * example above requires an input object which conforms to the bean specification, and 
 * which is composed of an object named "person1", which has attributes"name"
 * and "gender".  If an input object is supplied to the engine such that this rule
 * evaluates to true, then it is a candidate to have its action run, either by 
 * the engine, when {@link Engine#executeBestAction(String, Object, java.util.Collection)} is called, 
 * or by the application, when {@link Engine#getMatchingRules(String, Object)}
 * returns the rule and the application decides to run the action.<br>
 * <br>
 * Rules belong to namespaces, so that a single engine can be used to evaluate rules 
 * from different components within an application.  within a namespace, all rules must
 * have unique names (this is checked when adding rules to an engine).  The reason is that
 * rules can be composed of {@link SubRule}s and when they are composed in that manner, 
 * rules refer to subrules by their names.<br>
 * <br>
 * A rule has a priority too.  In certain cases, where the application only requires the 
 * best rule to be used, the priority helps the application decide which rule to run 
 * when there is more than one match.<br>
 * <br>
 * The description in a rule is imply to aid in rule management.<br>
 * <br>
 * Typically rules are customisable at runtime using some kind of administration UI.
 * While this framework does not provide an out of the box framework, it has been 
 * designed such that the rules could be created from a persistent store.
 * It is entirely conceivable that an application would load rules from a database
 * and execute existing actions based on the rules.  Only when a new action is 
 * required, would an application need to be upgraded and redeployed.<br>
 * <br>
 * For more info on rules, see <a href='http://mvel.documentnode.com/'>http://mvel.documentnode.com/</a>.
